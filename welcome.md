Welcome to the RoboSamurai Wiki, here you can find everything about my currently developed game RoboSamurai.

# *The Beginning*
**Wednesday, 4th of November 2020 08:19:54** marks the date this project came to life as then I created the game's respective folder named "3dgame" in my main documents folder. By 3rd of December i got my first concept art of the main character of the game done.

![insert nix concept art here][first-concept-art]

*The first ever digitalized design of "Nix". Very blocky, ironman-like design. The pre-design of this one didn't have the color purple nor a jetpack, I still remember it like it was today when my friend showed me some old-school anime that had characters in robosuits with big butterfly-like jetpack. All i can say is that i fell in love with them.*


# *The initial idea*

The idea i had for RoboSamurai was very different than what is right now. Even before the start of the developing process i always wanted to make a parkour *Mirror's Edge* inspiried game. I remember playing it as a very young kid and the main thing that i found very annoying was how not smooth it was. All of the movements in that game felt very limiting and undynamic of sorts. So I settled on an idea and started learning game dev.

That idea didn't last long, because i saw a rise in popularity of making game-dev videos about parkouring and dynamic movement. People like Dani or Steven suddenly became very popular from basically the same type of games they made. So i thought to myself "I need to make something less... generic". And how genius of me that I started making a dynamic sword-fighting game, about a mechanic trying to rescue his girlfriend from an evil company.

No, but really. I really do think this kind of narrative is really good for making fast and engaging stories for big or small games made by indie developers.
