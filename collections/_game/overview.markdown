Game Summary:

Nix decides to suit up and turn into a RoboSamurai to take on a challenge to defeat the corporate giant that is Nascent Industries - the one great obstacle in rescuing his long kidnapped girlfriend Elena. The goal is simple - Defeat the CEO. Sounded like an easy task until Nix realised that the creator of the deadliest corporation known to man is non other than his childhood friend Kira. Underestimating the sheer size of what she has created, Nix tries to battle his opponent, but fails.

Your goal is to rise from the ground up and stand face to face with the great danger as the story unravels the bigger, more evil plans of Nascent. Fast enough Nix's initial goal changes as he's presented with multiple ways of approaching the inevitable. 

As you travel around the city you will meet people who may help you or exploit you. You will form great relationships, accept many side contracts and fight your way through countless corporate buildings to get to your goal. Soon enough you will find out that you aren't the only one with a plan of destroying the infamous corporate giant. On your way, many child companies of Nascent will contact you and offer contracts as a price for intel on Elenas location (as if its a reliable source of information)

The RoboSamurai costume also comes with many modification capabilities. Scrap, sell, create with the parts you find when clearing floors, with some being more valuable than others. Collect them and you may be able to craft health, speed, weapon and many more upgrades to your suit.
