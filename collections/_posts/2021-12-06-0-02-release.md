Hi! Finally, after a rough 5 months of work I am finally proud to release another test build of my passion project game RoboSamurai.

I am honestly very proud with how the progress have been going for the past half a year. I made a lot of new mechanics, fixed lots of bugs and improved the already known systems in order to make the game feel more smooth to play and easier to control. Below you will find patch notes for the new build, as well as some insights to the new mechanics added. Please check them out.

# *Patch Notes*

  - Time cleared;
  - Enemies killed;
  - Score based on the two factors;
- Added high scores to the mission select screen;
- Improved ground checking;
- To continue dialogues F key is no longer used (Changed to E key);
- Added a walking mechanic - Press Tab to toggle walking (can be used to line jumps better);
- The player can now change the position of their equipped weapons in the Inventory menu;
- Added indication for changing between weapons (including unequipping them);

### Ability & Stat changes
- When the shield is not used (although is not included in the build), the player now automatically looks at where the camera is pointing;
- Added a out-of-combat regeneration mechanic (only used in the second level);
- Reduced base player speed from 90 to 65;
- Complete dodge rework:
  - Changed the way it physically works from moving the player to adding a physical impulse;
  - The player can dodge at any time;
  - Nix dodges based on player's input, not just left and right;
  - Cooldown has been changed to 1.5 seconds;
- Added coolodown display for abilities that have cooldowns;
- Rewrote dashing:
  - The player can now dash in mid-air by clicking the ctrl key if there are no enemies nearby;
  - If there are enemies nearby instead they will get launched in the direction of the enemy in order to make aiming easier and kill the enemy faster;

### Combat changes

  - Removed the Stealth Knife as a viable weapon (and is now called a Stealth Dagger);
  - Stealth Dagger now only appears when the player is prompted to Stealth Kill an enemy (still kills the enemy in one shot);

  - Stealth kills can be performed only when facing the enemy from behind;
- Moved the camera to the right of the player for easier aiming;

- Added ziplines to better traverse the level;

### Enemy changes
- Added indication when enemies start spotting the player and when they see the player;
- Added indication when enemies are stunned and damaged;
- Each enemy now drops extra loot for killing (doesn't do anything yet, but you can preview your loot by clicking I to pull up the inventory menu);
- Added laser sentries in order for the player to not go in certain places;
- Added new procedural animations for the Mantis and other bug enemies that have procedurally animated limbs (you can download the system's project files from [https://github.com/metapika/unity-procedural-animation](https://github.com/metapika/unity-procedural-animation));

### UI changes
- Changed "Withdraw" in the pause menu to "Quit";


# *New Enemies*

In this build, I decided to take a meele approach to enemies. I had a lot of complaints about the spider enemy from the last build. I fixed 90% of the complains about the enemy, yet I decided to not include it in the latest build (mostly because I want people to focus on the melee enemies since that's the type I'm planning to explore the most in the final game).

### Cyber Mantis
(Please do note that enemy names are a subject to change)

![mantisEnemy][mantisEnemy]

The Mantis enemy appears in the first level of the game. It's a fast moving enemy with dynamic attacks that don't do much damage. It's very easy to stun, has less health and has a shorter view distance compared to other enemies. Most of the times it's not even worth for Nix to get spotted by it as the stealth kill doesn't alert other enemies around it. With good platforming skills you can get around most of them without getting attacked as they are very big robots that can't fit in many places.

### Robot Wasp

![waspEnemy][waspEnemy]

You can meet the wasp in the second level. Compared to the mantis it is slower on the base speed, but has a charge mode that it activates when it's too far from you. It's attacks are easily dodgable, but you will need to take a couple hits to destroy it. Be aware of its view distance tho, as it can see really far and on top of that it has a longer range of alerting others around it, so be careful.

### Minimap scanner

![scanner][scanner]

With the new enemies and their definietely not overpowered attack options I decided to let Nix have an enemy scanner. You can now see enemies around you by looking in the top right corner of your screen. If there are any enemies nearby a purple dot will be displayed marking its position. Very handy when walking around multiple walls! 

# *New Movement options*

### Peaking around corners

![peak][peak]

First movement option is peaking around corners - very straight forward. You go up to a barrier or a box (most are blue, but you can peak around some buildings too) click **V** and you will be able to walk around the box. From here the camera has a bigger field of view so you can plan your combat strategies without the risk of getting spotted by enemies. 

### Climbing

![climb][climb]

Sometimes the double jump gets you not enough vertical position, thats why Nix can now climb on specifically colored (green) walls. All you have to do is come up to a wall and Nix will automatically climb all the way to the top.

### Ledge grabbing

![ledge][ledge]

Since Nix will often jump great distances not always will he reach the ending goal. That's why I created a ledge grab mechanic. When falling and next to an avaible edge Nix will automatically grab it. You can decide what to do next: if you press C Nix will fall down, if you press Space, Nix will jump, if you press W, Nix will climb up the ledge. The choice is yours for the take.

# *New Levels*

### Storage Rooms

![stealth][stealth]

(These level summaries are short since I don't want to spoil anything for you)

All 3 levels are based on a fundamental part of the final product that I'm trying to achieve. First level is a stealth based level. You are given only the stealth dagger in order to traverse the level. There is a total of 15 enemies to kill. If you kill all of them you will get better scores, but don't get too slow since timer plays a big role on the scoring system.

### Nascent HQ Exit

![combat][combat]

It's hard to explain this level if you haven't read the story overview ([you can do so here][gameOverview]). This is supposed to be a office/office halls/rooftop floor of a corporate building type thing with the ending being a helicopter landing zone. 32 enemies to kill. Run fast. Kill fast. Win fast.

### Cargo Shipment Rooms

![platforming][platforming]

This level is about platforming. Imagine it's placed roughly at the beggining of the final game. It's supposed to test your decision making and cooldown control in order to perfectly jump around flying cargos. Not a long level tbh, because I didn't want to include any enemies in this one just to make it a bit chill and show off the movement controller a bit.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you will stick around for more. See you in our capitalist dystopia.

Meta out.
